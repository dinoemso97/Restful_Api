PHP(PDO) Restful API with MySQL database.
This API use to easily handle with data in database and values to insert in database.
You can read,create,update and delete data in database and I use Postman software to use this API.

DATABASE: 
In file "database" you can see database "restfulapi.sql". 
Use your localhost/phpMyAdmin and import this database to your server.

Also in file "database" you can open "database.php" on your local server, 
just type in: localhost/restfulapi/database/database.php and database 
will be created on your phpMyAdmin.
